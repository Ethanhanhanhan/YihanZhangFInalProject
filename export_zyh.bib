   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The goal of each approach is to provide the user with the ability to apply the flexibility of ggplot2 to the visualization of network data, including through the mapping of network attributes to specific plot aesthetics. By incorporating networks in the ggplot2 framework, these approaches (1) allow users to enhance networks with additional information on edges and nodes, (2) give access to the strengths of ggplot2, such as layers and facets, and (3) convert network data objects to the more familiar data frames.},

   abstract = {ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) has been identified as the molecular defect in Tangier disease. It is biochemically characterized by absence of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the circulation, resulting in the accumulation of cholesterol in lymphoid tissues. Accumulation of cholesterol in arteries is an underlying cause of atherosclerosis, and HDL-C levels are inversely associated with the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). ABCA1 increases HDL-C levels by driving the generation of new HDL particles in cells, and cellular cholesterol is removed in the process of HDL generation. Therefore, pharmacological strategies that promote the HDL biogenic process by increasing ABCA1 expression and activity have been intensively studied to reduce ASCVD. Many ABCA1-upregulating agents have been developed, and some have shown promising effects in pre-clinical studies, but no clinical trials have met success yet. ABCA1 has long been an attractive drug target, but the failed clinical trials have indicated the difficulty of therapeutic upregulation of ABCA1, as well as driving us to: improve our understanding of the ABCA1 regulatory system; to develop more specific and sophisticated strategies to upregulate ABCA1 expression; and to search for novel druggable targets in the ABCA1-dependent HDL biogenic process. In this review, we discuss the beginning, recent advances, challenges and future directions in ABCA1 research aimed at developing ABCA1-directed therapies for ASCVD.},

   abstract = {Background: Data transformations are commonly used in bioinformatics data processing in the context of data projection and clustering. The most used Euclidean metric is not scale invariant and therefore occasionally inappropriate for complex, e.g., multimodal distributed variables and may negatively affect the results of cluster analysis. Specifically, the squaring function in the definition of the Euclidean distance as the square root of the sum of squared differences between data points has the consequence that the value 1 implicitly defines a limit for distances within clusters versus distances between (inter-) clusters. Methods: The Euclidean distances within a standard normal distribution (N(0,1)) follow a N(0,2) distribution. The EDO-transformation of a variable X is proposed as EDO=X/(2·s) following modeling of the standard deviation s by a mixture of Gaussians and selecting the dominant modes via item categorization. The method was compared in artificial and biomedical datasets with clustering of untransformed data, z-transformed data, and the recently proposed pooled variable scaling. Results: A simulation study and applications to known real data examples showed that the proposed EDO scaling method is generally useful. The clustering results in terms of cluster accuracy, adjusted Rand index and Dunn’s index outperformed the classical alternatives. Finally, the EDO transformation was applied to cluster a high-dimensional genomic dataset consisting of gene expression data for multiple samples of breast cancer tissues, and the proposed approach gave better results than classical methods and was compared with pooled variable scaling. Conclusions: For multivariate procedures of data analysis, it is proposed to use the EDO transformation as a better alternative to the established z-standardization, especially for nontrivially distributed data.
